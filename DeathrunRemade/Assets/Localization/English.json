You will need all the skills you've learned to handle the onslaught of aggressive creatures, increased damage, the unbreathable atmosphere, nitrogen and 'The Bends', the engulfing radiation, the expensive fabrication costs, and many other hazards!\n\nDeathrun is less about winning and more about how much you can achieve before meeting your untimely demise. Your score improves the longer you survive and the more progress you make in the game. Good luck!",
  "Ency_Deathrun_Aggression": "Creature Aggression",

  "EncyDesc_Deathrun_Atmosphere": "The atmosphere of planet 4546B is poisonous to humans. Alterra provides you with blueprints for high-tech floating pumps capable of filtering the surface air to a breathable mixture.\n\nAll purchases final. Alterra makes no guarantees for the continued operation of these pumps in environments with high background radiation.\n\n1. Use filter pumps to breathe surface air.",
  "Ency_Deathrun_CrushDepth": "Crush Depth",
  "EncyDesc_Deathrun_CrushDepth": "An unaided diver on planet 4546B should venture no deeper than {0}m without either an improved diving suit or submersible support.

  "Ency_Deathrun_Nitrogen": "Nitrogen and The Bends",
  "EncyDesc_Deathrun_Nitrogen": "The deeper you go, the higher your blood nitrogen level will be. In Deathrun your 'Safe Depth' will tend to settle out at about 3/4 of your current depth, so you'll want to get close to that depth without going above it, and then wait for your safe depth to improve. You must also avoid ascending too *quickly* (i.e. you can no longer just hold down the ascent button at all times), otherwise your nitrogen levels will increase rapidly.\nFirst Aid kits and floating air pumps can help with returning from the depths — eating certain kinds of native life may help as well.\n\nIn real life, 'The Bends', or decompression sickness, results from nitrogen bubbles forming in the bloodstream. The deeper a diver goes, the faster nitrogen accumulates in their bloodstream. If they ascend slowly and make appropriate 'deco stops' and 'safety stops', the nitrogen is removed as they exhale. But if they ascend too quickly, the nitrogen forms bubbles which can cause rashes, joint pains, lung damage, paralysis, and even death.\n\n1. Ascend slowly.\n2. Watch your 'Safe Depth' and Accelerometer.",
  "Ency_Deathrun_PowerCosts": "Increased Power Usage",
  "EncyDesc_Deathrun_PowerCosts": "The costs of fabrication (as well as battery charging, scanning, and water filtration) have increased dramatically following the imposition of the Fair Robotic Labor Standards Act. You may find that fabricators cost as much as {0} Alterra Standard Units per use. Power likewise recharges rather slowly.\n\nIn irradiated areas, the interference caused by radiation will further increase power use. Expect an increase of {1}x the normal cost.",
  "Ency_Deathrun_Radiation": "Radioactive Fallout",
  "EncyDesc_Deathrun_Radiation": "In the aftermath of a quantum drive explosion large amounts of radiation is known to seep into the immediate area. Radioactive particles commonly settle on the surface as well as any bodies of water up to a depth of around {0}m until trained staff seals the drive core and prevents further radiation leakage.\n\n1. Radiation affects the surface.\n2. Radiation penetrates up to {0}m below the surface.\n3. Repair any leaks to ameliorate effects.",
  "Ency_Deathrun_VehicleDecompression": "Vehicle Decompression",
  "EncyDesc_Deathrun_VehicleDecompression": "The Seamoth and Prawn Suit provide a sealed pressure environment for their pilots, preventing decompression sickness while they are being used. This does however result in significant power drain whenever the pilot exits the vehicle at depth — the deeper the exit, the higher the cost. Disembarking at a Moon Pool or directly into a Cyclops does not incur this cost. The Cyclops itself features a more sophisticated airlock system and can always be exited without any energy drain.",
  "Ency_Deathrun_AuroraFiltration": "Aurora Filtration Systems",
  "EncyDesc_Deathrun_AuroraFiltration": "The Aurora features a sophisticated air filtration system. Based on patented Alterra technology, it provides a clean and safe atmosphere onboard the vessel even on long distance journeys, ensuring optimal productivity of Alterra staff.\n\nAlterra advises staff not to pay attention to jealous detractors criticising the supposedly immense power draw of the system.",
